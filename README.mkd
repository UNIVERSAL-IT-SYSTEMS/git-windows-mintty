# [MinTTY][] for [Git for Windows][]
Free yourself from the `cmd.exe` console, and enjoy a modern terminal emulator.

# About
Adds a context menu (right-click) item to folders for "Git Bash Here (MinTTY)" which will open your standard Git Bash in the very comfortable [MinTTY][] console instead of the painful Windows one. Uninstall will similarly remove the entry, keeping things nice and tidy.

Includes MinTTY 1.0.3, MSYS version.

# Credits

This package is mostly just a nice installer around [MinTTY][], a Windows Scripting Host script, and the registry entries needed to add a context menu item. It must be installed to the same place as Git, and you must already have [Git for Windows][] installed.
